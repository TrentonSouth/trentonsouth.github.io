       <h2>Rental Agreement</h2>
      <div id="agreement">
         <p>I authorize a deposit equal to $50.00 USD plus local state tax to be charged to my credit card for each scooter rented and the final amount due 
            24 hours before equipment rental begins. I understand I am fully responsible for the scooter during the rental period and any damage or loss 
            incurred while in my possession and affirm I have provided accurate height and weight information to assure proper use and performance of the 
            equipment I am renting. I may cancel my rental and receive a full refund up to 48 hours prior to my rental delivery time and must call in my 
            cancellation to Scoots at 1.800.333.0594 and receive a cancellation confirmation number. I understand that I qualify for free 
            delivery only if I choose to rent a scooter for three (2) days or more and that my delivery and/or pick-up location is within 10 miles of the 
            Walt Disney World Resort. Further, I understand that in the event that I reserve a scooter for less than three (3) days or if my requested 
            delivery and/or pick-up location is between 11 and 20 miles from the Walt Disney World Resort I will be assessed an additional delivery charge 
            as calculated by the company, and that if I require delivery to or pick-up from a location further than 20 miles from the Walt Disney World 
            Resort I must contact Scooter Vacations for prior approval. If my scooter is not present at the pick-up location at the time I designate 
            (during reservation or by pre-arrangement by phone), I understand that I will be charged for the extra rental day(s) in excess of this 
            ateness, with the first penalty day beginning at the time of the originally negotiated pick-up time, and that I will further incur a 
            supplemental pick-up fee of $25. I acknowledge that this policy also applies in the event that neither I nor my representative are in attendance 
            at the scheduled delivery or pick-up time for any location that requires my presence for service, such a private home or gated community. I also 
            agree to a 60 minute time variance for delivery.</p>

         <p>I hereby agree to take sole responsibility for any damages outside of normal wear and tear of the mobility scooter unit including accessories 
            such as the battery charger and key while in my possession; my possession starts when my rental equipment is delivered and ends when the rental 
            equipment is back in the possession of Scooter Vacations. I understand that I am personally responsible for all vandalism and or loss of equipment 
            and I authorize Scoots to charge any damages to my credit card provided for rental. I understand and authorize 
            Scoots to charge my credit card a lost battery charger fee of $80 and a lost key fee of $10. In the case that I 
            request Scooter Vacations to deliver to me a replacement battery charger or key, or if I request delivery of additional batteries because I have 
            not properly charged my original batteries after each use, I will be assessed an additional delivery fee of $25 as long as the delivery location 
            is within 10 miles of my original delivery location and/or at one of the Orlando area theme parks. in addition, I understand that if I take the 
            equipment out of the 10 mile delivery area Scooter Vacations will not be able to provide me with service or replacement of my scooter or any part 
            thereof and I will hold Scooter Vacations harmless in said instances. Furthermore if I am outside the delivery area aforementioned areas, 
            replacement items will not be deliverable to me. If any dispute arises regarding the entirety of this agreement and my rental, I agree to a third 
            party company appointed by JA&K Marketing d.b.a Scooter Vacations, not associated with either myself or JA&K Marketing d.b.a Scooter Vacations, 
            will decide the cost of damages or replacement value if both parties cannot reach a mutual agreement. The renter shall pay any legal fees incurred 
            by JA&K Marketing d.b.a Scooter Vacations to obtain monies owed by the renter.</p>

         <p>I understand that, in the event that I rent a scooter while lodging at a Scooter Vacations registered Reservation Partner or On-Site Rental Partner 
            hotel or resort, or if I book through and/or travel with a registered Reservation Partner tour organizer or group travel service, Scooter Vacations 
            and its representatives may, at their exclusive discretion, choose to suspend any or all customer delivery and/or supplementary or replacement accessory 
            fees as outlined above as part of Scooter Vacationsâ€™ negotiated written agreements with individual Reservation Partner companies. In such cases, I 
            understand that Scooter Vacations may notify me directly or via the participating Reservation Partner with any amendments to my reservation.</p>

         <p>Waiver of Liability and Hold Harmless Agreement</p>

         <p>I hereby release, waive, and discharge the right to seek medical reimbursement or the legal prosecution of Scoots for 
            any physical injury resulting or property damage from the use of the rental equipment provided by Scoots.  I agree to be the sole person driving the 
            rental scooter and I am fully responsible for any person/s who, with or without my consent, sit on, stand, ride on or operate the mobility scooter.</p>

         <p>I agree to immediately cease using the rental equipment if I find or suspect any fault with the equipment. I hereby indemnify Scoots for any legal 
            prosecution from my rental or use of the equipment including but not limited to physical injury resulting to myself or someone else or property damage 
            from the rental equipment provided by Scoots.</p>

         <p>It is my express intent that this Release and Hold Harmless Agreement shall bind my family if I am alive and my heirs, assigns and personal 
            representative if I am deceased. It shall be deemed as a release, waiver, discharge, and covenant not to sue Scoots, independent contractors, officers, 
            agents, employees, and affiliates.</p>
